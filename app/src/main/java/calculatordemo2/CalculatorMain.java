 * Main runner that initializes and runs the UI

 * Special Notes:
 *
 * Pressing a single operator button will immediately display the result without pressing "="
 * After pressing an operand, sometimes the first button press immediately after will not register
 * By using a list/array button implementation generation, you limit the flexibility in positioning
 * the buttons
